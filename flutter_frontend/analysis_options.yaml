# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.

  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the

  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
